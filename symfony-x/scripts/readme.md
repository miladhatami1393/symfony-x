# Scripts

the goal is to have minimal chores or tasks. These scripts represent a failure to do that. 
they must be minimized, and should be thought of as a to-do list. i haven't really used them yet
so be careful.

update: don't use any of these unless you are sure you need to AND you know what you're doing (undestand what the script does and why). ask AI chat if unsure.
