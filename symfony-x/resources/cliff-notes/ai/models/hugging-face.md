## 5. How Hugging Face Works
Hugging Face's tools and libraries are designed to work seamlessly with modern machine learning pipelines:

### General Workflow:
1. **Model Selection**:
   - Choose a model from the **Hugging Face Hub** or use a local model.
2. **Loading the Model**:
   ```python
   from transformers import pipeline
   generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2')
   ```
3. **Using the Model**:
   ```python
   result = generator("Once upon a time")
   print(result)
   ```

### Training and Fine-Tuning:
Hugging Face provides pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned on custom datasets using straightforward APIs:
- **Load a Pre-Trained Model**:
   ```python
   from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments
   model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
   ```
- **Fine-Tune with `Trainer`**:
   ```python
   training_args = TrainingArguments(output_dir='./results', num_train_epochs=3)
   trainer = Trainer(model=model, args=training_args, train_dataset=train_data)
   trainer.train()
   ```
