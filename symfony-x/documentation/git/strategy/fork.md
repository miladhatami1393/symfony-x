Certainly! Based on your scenario, where:

The simple app serves as a base or template.
The web app version builds upon and extends the simple app's code.
You want changes made to the simple app to be merged into the web app version, accepting that some merging effort is needed.
Given these requirements, the best strategy is to use Git's forking workflow with upstream remotes. This approach allows you to:

Keep the web app version in a separate repository.
Continue developing the web app independently while still being able to merge changes from the simple app.
Manage and resolve merge conflicts as they arise.
Below is a step-by-step guide on how to implement this strategy.

1. Fork the Simple App Repository
Fork the simple app repository to create a copy under your GitHub account for the web app version.

On GitHub:
Navigate to the simple app repository.
Click the Fork button in the upper right corner.
Choose your GitHub account as the destination.
This creates a new repository, yourusername/simple-app, which will serve as the starting point for your web app version.

2. Clone Your Fork Locally
Clone the forked repository to your local machine and navigate into it:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-app.git web-app-version
cd web-app-version
3. Set Up the Original Simple App as an Upstream Remote
Add the original simple app repository as an upstream remote to fetch updates later:

bash
Copy code
git remote add upstream https://github.com/originalusername/simple-app.git
Verify your remotes:

bash
Copy code
git remote -v
You should see both origin (your fork) and upstream (the original repository).

4. Create a New Branch for Web App Development
Create and switch to a new branch where you'll develop the web app version:

bash
Copy code
git checkout -b web-app-version
This keeps your customizations separate from the main branch, which can track upstream changes.

5. Develop the Web App Version
Extend the Simple App: Add new features and modify existing code to build your web app version.
Commit Regularly: Keep your commit history clean and descriptive.
Example:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Add web-specific features and enhancements"
6. Incorporate Updates from the Simple App
When updates are made to the simple app, you can merge those changes into your web app version.

Step 1: Fetch Updates from Upstream
bash
Copy code
git fetch upstream
This fetches new commits from the simple app's main branch.

Step 2: Merge Updates into Your Branch
bash
Copy code
git checkout web-app-version
git merge upstream/main
Resolve Conflicts: If there are merge conflicts, Git will pause the merge. Open the affected files, resolve the conflicts, then add and commit the changes.

bash
Copy code
git add conflicted_file.ext
git commit
Complete the Merge: Once conflicts are resolved, the merge will complete.

7. Push Changes to Your Repository
After merging, push your updated branch to your GitHub repository:

bash
Copy code
git push origin web-app-version
8. Repeat as Necessary
Continue developing on the web-app-version branch.
Periodically fetch and merge updates from the simple app's main branch.
Handle merge conflicts as they arise.
Additional Considerations
Keeping the main Branch in Sync
Optionally, keep your fork's main branch in sync with the upstream repository:

bash
Copy code
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
This way, the main branch mirrors the simple app's main branch, and your custom development remains on web-app-version.

Using Rebasing Instead of Merging
For a linear history:

bash
Copy code
git checkout web-app-version
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
Note: Rebasing rewrites history. Avoid rebasing public branches or if collaborating with others on the same branch.
Handling Merge Conflicts
Identify Conflicts: Git will list files with conflicts.

Resolve Conflicts: Open each conflicted file, search for <<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>> markers, and edit accordingly.

Mark as Resolved:

bash
Copy code
git add resolved_file.ext
Continue Merging or Rebasing:

For merging:

bash
Copy code
git commit
For rebasing:

bash
Copy code
git rebase --continue
Alternative Strategy: Using Git Subtrees
If you prefer to include the simple app within your web app repository as a subdirectory, Git subtrees can be an effective method.

Adding the Simple App as a Subtree
bash
Copy code
git subtree add --prefix=simple-app https://github.com/originalusername/simple-app.git main --squash
--prefix=simple-app: The directory where the simple app will be added.
--squash: Combines the simple app's history into a single commit for simplicity.
Pulling Updates
bash
Copy code
git subtree pull --prefix=simple-app https://github.com/originalusername/simple-app.git main --squash
Advantages of Subtrees
No Extra Repository: Only one repository to manage.
Simpler Cloning: Contributors clone a single repository without extra steps.
Disadvantages
Complexity with Conflicts: Merges can become complicated if both codebases change significantly.
Repository Size: May increase due to the included history of the simple app.
When to Use Subtrees
When you want the simple app's code integrated into your repository while maintaining the ability to pull updates.
Recommendation
Given your needs:

Desire to Extend the Simple App: You want to build upon the simple app's code.
Need to Merge Updates: You accept the merging process to incorporate changes.
Separate Repositories: Preferably keep the web app version in its own repository.
Therefore, using the forking strategy with upstream remotes is the most appropriate. It provides:

Independence: Your web app version can evolve separately.
Connectivity: Ability to pull in updates from the simple app.
Control: Full control over when and how updates are merged.
Summary of Steps
Fork the Simple App Repository: Creates your own copy for the web app version.
Clone Your Fork Locally: Begin working on your local machine.
Add Upstream Remote: Set up the original simple app as upstream to fetch updates.
Create web-app-version Branch: Isolate your development.
Develop Your Web App: Extend and customize as needed.
Fetch and Merge Updates: Incorporate changes from the simple app when necessary.
Resolve Conflicts: Handle any merge conflicts that arise.
Push Changes to Your Fork: Keep your repository updated.
Repeat: Continue this process throughout development.
Example Workflow
Initial Setup
bash
Copy code
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-app.git web-app-version
cd web-app-version

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/originalusername/simple-app.git

# Create and switch to the web app branch
git checkout -b web-app-version
Developing
bash
Copy code
# Make changes
# ...

# Stage and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Implement feature X in web app"
Merging Updates from Simple App
bash
Copy code
# Fetch upstream changes
git fetch upstream

# Merge into your branch
git checkout web-app-version
git merge upstream/main

# Resolve any conflicts
# ...

# Commit merge
git commit

# Push updates
git push origin web-app-version
Notes
Regular Merging: Frequently merge updates from the simple app to minimize conflicts.
Communication: Stay informed about significant changes in the simple app to anticipate potential conflicts.
Documentation: Keep good records of changes in both repositories to aid in conflict resolution.
Alternative Considerations
If your web app version and simple app share substantial code and you foresee complex merging issues, you might consider:

Modularizing Shared Code: Extract common functionality into a shared library or module that both apps depend on.
Monorepo Approach: Use a single repository with separate directories or branches for each app.
However, these approaches may introduce additional complexity and may not align with your preference for separate repositories.

Conclusion
By forking the simple app repository and setting it as an upstream remote, you can effectively:

Extend the simple app in your web app version.
Merge changes from the simple app into your web app as updates are made.
Maintain separate repositories for clarity and organization.
This strategy balances the need for shared code updates with the flexibility to develop your web app independently.
