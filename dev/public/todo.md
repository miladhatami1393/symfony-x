# To Do List

### AssetMapper and Tailwind 
I think there's an issue with dev env and tailwind with this docker config
Skipping for now, but need to remember



### symfony project template
i'm thinking that i'd like to create the symfony proj on initial `docker-compose up` by creating the proj from a composer package in the entrypoint.sh first time running


### default welcome site as setup wizard 
use the default web site to setup the project

#### create a composer package for symfony-x dev admin (has dev related tools, dashboard with sqlite for managing project, use OpenAI/Ollama for analysis / management)
