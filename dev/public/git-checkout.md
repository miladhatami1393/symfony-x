# git checkout

### **Is `git checkout` Local or Integrated with GitHub?**

**`git checkout` is a local command.** It operates on your local Git repository and does not directly interact with GitHub or any other remote repositories.

### **Local vs. Remote Operations**

- **Local Operations**: Commands like `git add`, `git commit`, `git checkout`, and `git branch` affect only your local repository on your computer.
- **Remote Operations**: Commands like `git push`, `git fetch`, and `git pull` are used to communicate with remote repositories such as GitHub.

### **Working with Branches and GitHub**

Here's how you can work with branches in a GitHub workflow:

#### **1. Creating a New Branch Locally**

When you run:

```bash
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```

or using the newer command:

```bash
git switch -c new-branch-name
```

You're creating a new branch **locally** and switching to it. This branch exists only on your computer at this point.

#### **2. Making Changes and Committing Locally**

You can now make changes to your files, stage them, and commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

These changes are recorded in your local repository.

#### **3. Pushing Your Branch to GitHub**

To make your local branch available on GitHub, you need to push it:

```bash
git push origin new-branch-name
```

- **`origin`** refers to the default name of the remote repository (GitHub).
- This command creates a new branch on GitHub named `new-branch-name` and uploads your commits to it.

#### **4. Creating a Pull Request on GitHub**

Once your branch is on GitHub, you can create a Pull Request (PR) through the GitHub website:

- Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
- You should see a prompt to create a PR for your recently pushed branch.
- Follow the prompts to create the PR, where your code can be reviewed before merging.

### **Understanding the Workflow**

- **Local Branch Creation**: `git checkout -b` is used to create and switch to a new branch locally.
- **Local Development**: You make and commit changes on your local branch.
- **Pushing to Remote**: `git push` is used to upload your local branch and commits to GitHub.
- **Pull Requests and Collaboration**: After pushing, GitHub's web interface is used to manage PRs and code reviews.

### **Key Points**

- **`git checkout` is Local**: It does not communicate with GitHub. It manipulates your local branches and files.
- **Integration with GitHub Happens via Push/Pull**: Commands like `git push` and `git pull` handle synchronization between your local repository and GitHub.
- **Branches are Local Until Pushed**: A new branch you create won't appear on GitHub until you push it.
- **Pull Requests are on GitHub**: After pushing your branch, you use GitHub's interface to create PRs and collaborate.

### **Why This Matters**

Understanding that `git checkout` is a local operation helps you:

- **Manage Your Workspace**: Safely create and switch between branches without affecting the remote repository or other collaborators.
- **Control When to Share**: You decide when to push your changes to GitHub, allowing you to work independently until your code is ready.

### **Example Workflow**

1. **Clone the Repository (if you haven't already):**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
   cd repository
   ```

2. **Create and Switch to a New Local Branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature
   ```

3. **Work Locally:**

   - Make changes to your files.
   - Stage and commit your changes:

     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Add new feature"
     ```

4. **Push Your Branch to GitHub:**

   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/new-feature
   ```

   - The `-u` flag sets the remote branch as the upstream reference for `git pull` and `git push` in future.

5. **Create a Pull Request on GitHub:**

   - Go to your repository on GitHub.
   - Click on "Compare & pull request" to start the PR process.

### **Summary**

- **Local Commands**: `git checkout`, `git branch`, `git commit`—these affect only your local repository.
- **Remote Commands**: `git push`, `git pull`, `git fetch`—these communicate with GitHub or other remote repositories.
- **Workflow Integration**: You work locally and use `git push` to upload your branches and commits to GitHub.
